This is the backend part of the IMS (Inventory Management System) project, implemented using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

## Project Overview

The IMS backend provides the server-side functionality for the IMS application, which addresses the challenges faced by the department in managing inventory and material procurement efficiently. The system streamlines the process of material requisition, procurement, and consumption tracking across multiple branches and employees. It offers the following key functionalities:

- Online Material Requisition: Branches can request various types of materials online, replacing the manual process.
- Inventory Management: The system tracks and manages the inventory of stationery and other items efficiently.
- Consumption Reports: Generate consumption reports, both branchwise and employeewise, to monitor and analyze material usage.

## Features

- User registration and login with JWT authentication.
- API endpoints for managing material requisitions, inventory, and consumption data.
- Middleware for request handling, including error handling and authentication.
